# Automated Multi-Blog System Documentation

## System Architecture

The Automated Multi-Blog System is a serverless, AI-powered content generation and publishing platform designed for managing multiple blogs with minimal human intervention. The system leverages Azure Functions, OpenAI, and WordPress integration to provide a comprehensive solution for automated content creation and management.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    subgraph "Azure Functions"
        CF[CreateRunFolder] --> |Triggers| RT[ResearchTopic]
        RT --> |Research Data| CG[ContentGenerator]
        CG --> |Generated Content| PUB[Publisher]
        PUB --> |Publish Results| RL[ResultsLogger]
        PUB --> |Published Content| SMP[SocialMediaPromoter]
    end

    subgraph "Storage"
        BS[(Blob Storage)]
    end

    subgraph "External Services"
        OAI[OpenAI API]
        WP[WordPress API]
        GA[Google Analytics]
        SM[Social Media APIs]
    end

    AD --> GA
```

## Data Flow

The system follows a sequential flow where each component performs a specific task and passes the results to the next component:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Scheduler as Scheduler
    participant Research as ResearchTopic
    participant Content as ContentGenerator
    participant SEO as SEOOptimizer
    participant Publish as Publisher
    participant Social as SocialMediaPromoter
    
    Scheduler->>Research: Trigger new content run
    Research->>Research: Research trending topics
    Research->>Content: Pass research data
    Content->>Content: Generate content with AI
    Content->>SEO: Pass draft content
    SEO->>SEO: Optimize for search engines
    SEO->>Publish: Pass optimized content
    Publish->>Publish: Publish to WordPress
    Publish->>Social: Pass publication details
    Social->>Social: Post to configured platforms
```

## Configuration System

The platform uses a configuration-driven approach where each blog has its own set of configuration files stored in a specific folder structure:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Root] --> B[Blog1]
    A --> C[Blog2]
    A --> D[Blog3]
    
    B --> B1[config.json]
    B --> B2[theme.json]
    B --> B3[topics.json]
    B --> B4[Generated]
    
    B4 --> B41[Run1]
    B4 --> B42[Run2]
    
    B41 --> B411[research.json]
    B41 --> B412[content.md]
    B41 --> B413[publish.json]
    
    C --> C1[config.json]
    C --> C2[theme.json]
    C --> C3[topics.json]
    C --> C4[Generated]
```

## Component State Machines

Each component in the system can be represented as a state machine that processes data and transitions between states:

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Init
    Init --> ResearchingTopics
    ResearchingTopics --> GeneratingOutline
    GeneratingOutline --> DraftingContent
    DraftingContent --> OptimizingContent
    OptimizingContent --> GeneratingImages
    GeneratingImages --> Publishing
    Publishing --> [*]
```

## Blog Creation Process

The process of creating a new blog involves several steps:

```mermaid

    A[User Input] --> B[Theme Configuration]
    B --> C[Domain Selection]
    C --> D[Integration Setup]
    D --> E[Initial Content Generation]
    E --> F[WordPress Deployment]
    F --> G[Analytics Integration]
```

## Theme-Aware Content Generation

The system uses theme-specific prompts and guidance to ensure content aligns with each blog's unique voice and style:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Blog Theme] --> B[Target Audience]
    A --> C[Tone Guidelines]
    A --> D[Style Parameters]
    A --> E[Content Types]
    A --> F[Relevant Keywords]
    
    B & C & D & E & F --> G[Theme Context]
    G --> H[Research Service]
    G --> I[Content Generator]
    G --> J[Image Generator]
```

## Analytics and Monitoring

The system includes comprehensive analytics and monitoring capabilities:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Blog Posts] --> B[Performance Tracking]
    B --> C[Google Analytics]
    B --> D[WordPress Analytics]
    B --> E[AdSense]
    B --> F[Search Console]
    
    C & D & E & F --> G[Unified Dashboard]
    G --> H[Performance Reports]
    G --> I[Content Recommendations]
```

## AI Cost Optimization

The system includes features to optimize AI usage and control costs:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[AI Request] --> B{Cache Check}
    B -->|Cache Hit| C[Return Cached Response]
    B -->|Cache Miss| D[Token Counter]
    D --> E[Model Selector]
    E --> F[API Request]
    F --> G[Response Cache]
    G --> H[Usage Tracking]
```

## Competitor Analysis System

The platform includes tools for analyzing competitor content and identifying opportunities:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Competitor URLs] --> B[Content Scraper]
    B --> C[Content Analysis]
    C --> D[Topic Extraction]
    C --> E[Keyword Analysis]
    C --> F[Structure Analysis]
    
    D & E & F --> G[Gap Analysis]
    G --> H[Content Recommendations]
    G --> I[Keyword Opportunities]
```

## Security and Authentication

The system uses Azure Key Vault for secure credential management:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Application] --> B[Managed Identity]
    B --> C[Key Vault]
    C --> D[WordPress Credentials]
    C --> E[API Keys]
    C --> F[Database Credentials]
```

## Deployment Process

The system is deployed using Azure Bicep templates and GitHub Actions:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[GitHub Repository] --> B[GitHub Actions]
    B --> C[Bicep Templates]
    C --> D[Resource Group]
    D --> E[Function App]
    D --> F[Storage Account]
    D --> G[Key Vault]
    D --> H[App Insights]
```

## Error Handling and Retry Mechanisms

The system includes comprehensive error handling and retry mechanisms:

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Running
    Running --> Failed : Error Occurs
    Failed --> Retry : Retry Attempt
    Retry --> Running : Success
    Retry --> Failed : Failure
    Retry --> DeadLetter : Max Retries Exceeded
    DeadLetter --> [*]
    Running --> Completed : Task Completes
    Completed --> [*]
```
